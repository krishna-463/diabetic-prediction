# diabetic-prediction (SVM)
prediction weather a person is diabetic or not.
here I got accuracy of training is approximately 78% and accuracy of testing is apprpximately 77%.
I think it is somewhat low due to the following reasons.
 1. Less data in the dataset.
 2. due to selection of svm model
But the accuracy is better than traditional diabeties testing
In these project I used support vector machine due to I want to make a project on every familiar machine learning model. thats why i used it
If you want more accuracy go with binary classifier model due to it consists of two classes only
